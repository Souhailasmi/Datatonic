    "The metric that we will use to quantify addiction is the time spend playing. In the Games_1, Games_2 datasets we have a feature `playtime_forever`that contains the time spend playing a given game by a given user. It could be optimal if we had a variable that gives us the playtime per day or per week, to see the repartition of the playing time. `Playtime_2weeks`is full of missing values so I prefered using the cumulated time playing. \n",
